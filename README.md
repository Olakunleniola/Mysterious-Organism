# Mysterious Organism 

## Overview

This project was part of my Codecademy bootcamp and revolves around simulating the DNA of a newly discovered organism, Pila aequor (P. aequor). As a member of a research team, the objective was to create objects that mimic the DNA of P. aequor for in-depth study.

## Project Goals

**Context**:

Our research team stumbled upon a mysterious organism at the ocean's bottom near hydrothermal vents. Dubbed Pila aequor (P. aequor), it consists of only 15 DNA bases. The unique challenge lies in the small DNA samples and frequent mutations due to hydrothermal vents, making P. aequor a captivating specimen for study. Unfortunately, P. aequor cannot survive above sea level, and locating it in the deep sea proves difficult and expensive.

## Running the Program
- Download the project files through your local terminal by running the command below: 
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Olakunleniola/Mysterious-Organism.git
    ```

+ Navigate to the project folder and run the command below
    
    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```

Note: You must have node installed on your computer to run this program

## Contribution Challenge
As a challenge for contributors, implement the following:

- **.complementStrand() Method**:
    * Create a .complementStrand() method for the factory function's object. This method should return the complementary DNA strand, where 'A's match with 'T's, and vice versa. 'C's match with 'G's, and vice versa.

+ **.compareDNA() Method**:
    * Utilize the existing .compareDNA() method to find the two most related instances of Pila aequor.

Feel free to contribute to enhance and expand the capabilities of the project. Your creativity and problem-solving skills are welcome!

Happy coding!
